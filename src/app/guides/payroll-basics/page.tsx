        <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-black/80 dark:text-white/80">
          Payroll is the process of calculating and distributing employee compensation. It includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and deductions for taxes, benefits, and other withholdings.
        </p>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-black/80 dark:text-white/80">
              Proper payroll management ensures employees are paid accurately and on time while maintaining compliance with labor laws and tax regulations.

            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-black/80 dark:text-white/80">
              <strong>Gross pay</strong> is the total amount earned before any deductions. This includes regular wages, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-black/80 dark:text-white/80">
              <strong>Net pay</strong> (take-home pay) is what employees receive after all deductions are subtracted from gross pay.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium tracking-tight">Common Deductions</h3>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-black/80 dark:text-white/80">
              Deductions fall into two categories: <strong>mandatory</strong> (taxes, Social Security, Medicare) and <strong>voluntary</strong> (health insurance, retirement contributions, parking).
